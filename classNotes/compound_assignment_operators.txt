Compound assignment operators

Compound assignment operators combines assignment operator with arithmatic operator.

Compound assignment operator are used toperform mathematical operations more easily.


                Variable op = expression

Variable    The variable to assign a value,
Op          It can be any arithmetic operator
expression  It can be a constant, variable or arithmatic expression.



                Examples

A += 10 is equivalent to A = A + 10
A -= 10 is equivalent to A = A - 10
A *= 10 is equivalent to A = A * 10
A /= 10 is equivalent to A = A / 10
A %= 10 is equivalent to A = A % 10
A //= 10 is equivalent to A = A // 10
A **= 10 is equivalent to A = A ** 10




>>> a = 10
>>> a
10
>>> a += 1
>>> a
11
>>> a -= 1
>>> a
10



>>> S = 1
>>> b = 20
>>> S = S + b * 10 / 30     # This exprerssion is evaluated first
>>> S += b * 10 / 30
>>> S
