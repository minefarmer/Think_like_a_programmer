Introduction to Iterations or Loops

A type of control structure that repeats a statement or block of statements is called looping structure or in short iterations.

In sequence, all instructions were executed in the same order that was defined.

In selection, some instructions were selected or skipped on the basis of condition.

In iterations, some instructions are repeated in a specific number of times.




        Types of loops / Iterations ****************************************

Counter-controlled Loops (in short for loops)
Conditional or sentinel-controlled Loops (in short while loops)
Infinite Loops

Examples:
For Loop: repeat the name of a student for 10 times
While Loop: keep entering the positive integer values untill user enters negative integer values
