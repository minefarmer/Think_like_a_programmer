A statement that assigns a value to a variable is called as assignment statement.


The assignment operator ( = ) is used in assignment statement to assign a value or computational result to a variable.


The name of the variable is written on the left hand side of the assignment operator and the value is written on the right side of the assignment operator.

The value can be constant, variable, expresion or function.



""" Syntax"""

Variable = Expression

Examples:
A = 100 (Constant Value on RHS)
C = A + B - C (Calculation on RHS)
Name = "Rich" (Constant Value on RHS)
C = B (Variable on RHS)
P pow(10, 2) # discussed later



>>> A = 100
>>> B = 20
>>> C = 30
>>> p = A + B - C
>>> name = "John"
>>> count = p
>>> p = p + 1
>>> count
90
>>> p
91
>>> 

>>> import math
>>> X = math.pow(10, 2)
