'''         Print Asterisks
Write a program that can print the line of asterisks. I have to define a founction called printAsterisks(). This finction should take single argument/parameter. This argument will take an interger value that represents the number of asterisks. My program should print the number of asterisks on a single line based on supplied integer value.

'''
def printAsterisks(N):
    print("*" * N) # **********


# main program starts here
printAsterisks(10)  # When the app is run [printAsterisks(10)] replaces the N on line 5 with [10], then the print statement replaces it,s N with 10, and then prints out 10 asterisks as shown.
