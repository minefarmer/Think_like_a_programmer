         Inheritance
A child inherits characteristics of it's parents.
Besides inherited characteristics, a child may have it's own unique characteristics.


Inhehitance is a form of software reusability in which new classes sre created from exisitin classes by "inheriting" their properties and behaviors.

If a class B inherits from class A then it contains all the characteristics (properties and behaviors) of class A

The parent class is called base class and the child class is called derived class (parent class -> superclass, child class -> subclass)


Besides inherited characteristics, derived class may have it's own unique characteristics. 
A child/derived class can override some behaviors in the parent/base class.
