        Abstract classes
An abstract class implemen ts an abstract concept
Main purpose is to be inherited by other classes
Can't be instantiated
Promotes reuse



        Concrete Classes 
A concrete class implements a concrete concept
Main purpose is to be instantiated
Provides implementation details specefic to the domain context
