        Example of List (one layer of abstraction)
10, 2.5, "Ali", 100, 60

        Example of function (another layer of abstraction)
     F1      F2      F3      F4
    code    code    code    code
        # they contain thier own code


        Disadvantages of Functional Oriented Programming
Functions are less reuseable in other programs.
Many functions are dependent on some global data for functioning.
Thus I cannot migrate a function to anothes program because they are heavily dependent on global data in thier original program.
It is better to use a class


        Class (another layer of abstration)

    Propertied (Data)
    |                   |   <- A class is another layer of abstration that contains both
    behaviors (Functions)      data and functions. 



*********   What is Object orientation?

A technique for system modeling

System ->a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a complex whole (Oxford dictionary)

Object orinrtated modules. OO model consists of several interaction objects.


            Soccer game Example

Player      Football        Ground
Audience    referee         score boaed


            Messages

Objects in a system communicate with each other through messages.
The sender object needs to call an appropriate operations on the reciever object.

A technique for system modeling.
System -> a set of things working together qas parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a complex whole(Oxford dictionary)

OO model consists of several interactiong objects


            Advantages of Object Orientation

People think in terms of objects.
OO models map to realityTherefore, OO models are easy yo develope and easy to understand.
