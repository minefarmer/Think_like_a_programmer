I can write my algorithms in simple english. It is called Pseudocode

befor i start writing my programs, I need to write the steps in simple English and then translate those steps to any programming language.



Example # 1: Temperature Converter
    # Always write the 'start' Word to tell the reader that this pseudocode is strating here.
1. Start.
2. Take the value of Temperature in Celsius from User.
3. Convert the Celsius degree to Fahrenheit using F = 9 / 5 * C + 32.
4. Display the Temperature in Fahrenheit to screen.

    # And always end the Pseudocode with the 'End' word
