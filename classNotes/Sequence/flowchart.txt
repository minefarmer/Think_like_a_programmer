""" Flowchart  """

Flow chart is a combination of two words = flow and chart.

A chart consists of differient symbole to display infarmation about any program.

Flow indicates the direction of proccessing that takes place in the program.

Flow chart is the graphical represantation of algorithm or pseudocode.

It is a way of visually presenting the flow of data, operations performed on the data and swquence of these operations.

Flow chart is commonly used to improve the logic for solving a problem.

Example -> layout plan of a building,





''' Flowchart Symbols  '''

Input/output

    Input Marks

    Print Marks

## For example parrallelogrames symbol is used to represent an input power output of the computer program
## Input symbol is used to get the input from the user and the output symbol is used to display a message to the user or to display a value,


1.Proccess
    ## A process can be any mathematical calculation.

    Sum = A + B
    ## This is one example of processing

2. Selection

    n > 50
    ## This is an example of processing

3. Start/End

    Start   End
    ## This symbol is used to represent the start or end of the flow chart.

4. Flow lines

        ^
        |
      <- ->
        |
        ^
    ## There are four flow lines.

5. Connector

        ## A big circle

        ## It is used when two or more flow symboles come from differient directions and move to one direction.

6. Function calculation

        ## The rectangle symbol with double lines on the left and right side is used to call a function.
        ## The name of the function with perameters is written inside the symbol.



# Example # 1: Temperature Converter

    1. Start
    2. Take the value of Temperature in Celsius from the user.
    3. Convert the  Celsius degree to Fahrenheit using F = 9 / 5 * C + 32
    4. Display the temperature in fahrenheit to screen.
    5. End
