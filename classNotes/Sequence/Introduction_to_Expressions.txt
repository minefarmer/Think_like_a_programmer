Expression

A statement that evaluates to a single value is called an expression.

An expression consists of operators and operands

Example:
A + S
M / N
x + 100

An expression that can add two numbers in variables and then store the results in a third variable.

X1 = 10
X2 = 20

X3 = X1 + X2


>>> a + b + c
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
    a + b + c
NameError: name 'a' is not defined                  (OOPS) bad

In python I need to define the variable before using them.
>>> a = 10
>>> b = 3
>>> c = 1
>>> a + b + c
14

>>>
>>> a / b * c
3.3333333333333335

>>>
>>> a * b / c + 100
130.0
